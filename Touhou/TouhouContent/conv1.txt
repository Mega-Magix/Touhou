Ah, it sure is nice out today.
I wonder how the others are doing?
*Enter:Marisa
-marisa2
Aha! There you are!
-reimu1
Hello, Marisa. How is everything going?
-marisa1
Pretty well. I still have to find some of the others. There are a lot of people in Gensokyo.
-reimu1
Yeah, you're right. Hey, does something about this place feel different to you?
-marisa1
Yeah. But don't worry, that's normal. The new Gensokyo is still in progress.
-marisa2
If I could find Suika, I would kick her butt to get this place finished sooner.
-reimu2
Hey, I want to do that!
*Music:Battle
-marisa2
Oh yeah? Then show me that you're strong enough.
-reimu2
Is that a challenge?
-marisa2
Of course it is!
-reimu2
*Speed:2
Alright! Then let's go!
